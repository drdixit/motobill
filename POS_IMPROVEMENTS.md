# POS Screen Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines all improvements made to the POS (Point of Sale) screen based on user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Quantity Calculation Not Working Properly
**Problem**: Quantity changes weren't updating cart totals immediately.

**Solution**: Changed from `onSubmitted` to `onChanged` callback in quantity TextField. Now calculations update in real-time as user types.

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/view/widgets/pos/pos_cart.dart` - Changed quantity input from `TextField` with `onSubmitted` to `TextFormField` with `onChanged`

### 2. Cart Item Count Display
**Problem**: No visual indication of cart items in the products section.

**Solution**: Added cart count badge in products header showing total items in cart with a shopping cart icon.

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/view/screens/pos_screen.dart` - Added cart count indicator next to product count

**Visual**: Green badge with shopping cart icon showing "{X} in cart"

### 3. Customer Selection Required for Checkout
**Problem**: Users could create bills without selecting a customer.

**Solution**:
- Added customer dropdown in cart header
- Checkout button is disabled when no customer is selected
- Red border around dropdown when no customer selected
- Warning message displayed below checkout button
- Customer list loaded from database

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/view_model/pos_viewmodel.dart` - Added customer state management
  - Added `customers` and `selectedCustomer` to PosState
  - Added `CustomerRepository` dependency
  - Added `selectCustomer()` method
  - Load customers in `loadInitialData()`
  - Clear customer when cart is cleared

- `lib/view/widgets/pos/pos_cart.dart` - Added customer UI
  - Customer dropdown in cart header
  - Disabled checkout button when no customer
  - Warning message when customer not selected
  - Checkout message shows selected customer name

### 4. Improved Cart Item Layout
**Problem**: Two-line layout was cramped and not properly aligned.

**Solution**: Redesigned cart items with better spacing and organization:
- **First Row**: Product name, part number, and delete button
- **Second Row**: Three columns
  - Left: Quantity input with label
  - Middle: Unit price with label
  - Right: Total amount with tax with labels

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/view/widgets/pos/pos_cart.dart` - Complete cart item layout redesign

**Improvements**:
- Clearer visual hierarchy
- Labels for each field (Qty, Price, Total)
- Better alignment and spacing
- Tax shown as "(+â‚¹X.XX tax)" under total
- Larger font for total amount
- Product name can wrap to 2 lines

### 5. Tax Made Non-Editable
**Problem**: Tax fields were editable which could cause calculation errors.

**Solution**: Tax is now calculated automatically and displayed as read-only information. Tax calculation happens in the ViewModel's `_createBillItem()` method.

**Note**: Tax rates are currently hardcoded as 18% GST (9% CGST + 9% SGST). This can be enhanced to use product-specific tax rates from the database.

### 6. Custom Price Support
**Problem**: No way to override product price for special cases.

**Solution**: Added `addToCartWithCustomPrice()` method to ViewModel that allows adding products with custom selling prices.

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/view_model/pos_viewmodel.dart` - Added `addToCartWithCustomPrice()` method

**Usage**: Currently implemented in ViewModel, UI integration pending based on requirements.

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Used Riverpod's `StateNotifier` pattern
- Async provider initialization for both PosRepository and CustomerRepository
- State properly manages customer selection and cart items

### Database Integration
- Integrated `CustomerRepository` for customer data
- Loads all active customers (not deleted)
- Follows soft-delete pattern (is_deleted = 0)

### UI/UX Improvements
- Better visual feedback for required fields (red border)
- Disabled states for unavailable actions
- Clear warning messages
- Real-time calculation updates
- Consistent spacing and alignment

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Price UI**: Add dialog or button to allow custom price entry per product
2. **Dynamic Tax Rates**: Use product's HSN code tax rates instead of hardcoded 18%
3. **Customer Quick Add**: Add button to create new customer without leaving POS
4. **Recent Customers**: Show frequently used customers at top of dropdown
5. **Customer Search**: Add search/filter in customer dropdown
6. **Bill Generation**: Implement actual checkout flow to save bill to database
7. **Print Receipt**: Add receipt printing functionality
8. **Discount Support**: Add line-item and bill-level discount features
