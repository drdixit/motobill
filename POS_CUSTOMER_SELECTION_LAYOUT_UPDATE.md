# POS Customer Selection Layout Update

**Date:** October 13, 2025

## Changes Made

### Customer Selection Moved from Cart to Products Section

**Before:**
- Customer selection dropdown was in the Cart header (right side)
- Located above cart items in the cart panel

**After:**
- Customer selection dropdown moved to Products section (middle panel)
- Located between the Products header and the products grid
- Fixed position (non-scrollable with products)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Cart Widget (`lib/view/widgets/pos/pos_cart.dart`)
**Removed:**
- Customer selection dropdown from cart header
- Customer-related styling and validation from cart header
- Unused `Customer` model import

**Updated:**
- Cart header now shows only:
  - Shopping cart icon
  - "Cart" title
  - Item count badge (if items exist)

### 2. POS Screen (`lib/view/screens/pos_screen.dart`)
**Added:**
- Customer selection section in `_buildProductsSection()`
- New fixed container between header and products grid
- Customer dropdown with same styling as before:
  - Red border when no customer selected
  - Green/normal border when customer selected
  - Error state styling preserved
  - Full functionality maintained

**Layout Structure:**
```
Products Section:
├── Header (Fixed)
│   ├── Products title
│   ├── Item count badge
│   └── Search bar
├── Customer Selection (Fixed - Non-scrollable)
│   └── Customer dropdown with validation
└── Products Grid (Scrollable)
    └── Product cards
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better UX Flow**
- Customer selection is now closer to product selection
- More logical workflow: Select customer → Select products → Review cart
- Customer selection visible while browsing products

### 2. **More Space in Cart**
- Cart header is simpler and cleaner
- More vertical space for cart items
- Easier to see cart summary

### 3. **Fixed Position**
- Customer selection doesn't scroll with products
- Always visible when adding items
- Reduces risk of forgetting to select customer

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Customer selection has prominence in products area
- Clear indication that customer must be selected before proceeding
- Error state (red border) more visible in main working area

## Visual Layout

### Before:
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Filters   │   Products   │    Cart     │
│             │              │ ┌─────────┐ │
│             │   Header     │ │Customer ▼│ │ ← Was here
│             │              │ └─────────┘ │
│             │   Search     │             │
│             │              │  Cart Items │
│             │   Products   │             │
│             │   (Grid)     │             │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### After:
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Filters   │   Products   │    Cart     │
│             │              │             │
│             │   Header     │   Header    │
│             │              │             │
│             │ ┌─────────┐  │  Cart Items │
│             │ │Customer ▼│  │ ← Cleaner   │
│             │ └─────────┘  │             │
│             │   ↑ Fixed    │             │
│             │   Products   │             │
│             │   (Grid)     │             │
│             │   ↓ Scrolls  │             │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
```

## Technical Notes

### Non-Scrollable Implementation
- Customer selection is in a separate `Container` outside the `Expanded` widget
- Only the products grid is wrapped in `Expanded` widget
- This ensures customer dropdown stays fixed while products scroll

### State Management
- Customer selection state remains in `PosViewModel`
- Same validation logic preserved
- No changes to business logic
- Only UI layout changed

### Error Handling
- Red border when no customer selected (unchanged)
- Warning message in cart checkout still works
- Validation prevents checkout without customer

## Files Modified

1. **lib/view/widgets/pos/pos_cart.dart**
   - Removed customer selection from header
   - Simplified cart header to title + item count
   - Removed unused Customer import

2. **lib/view/screens/pos_screen.dart**
   - Added customer selection section in products area
   - Positioned between header and products grid
   - Made it non-scrollable (fixed position)
