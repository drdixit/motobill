## Notes

- **Soft Delete Policy**: Never physically delete records. Always use `is_deleted = 1` for deletion.
- **Image Storage**: Store only filenames in database. Actual images stored in `C:\motobill\database\images\`.
- **Indexes**: Created for optimizing search and filtering operations.
- **Data Snapshot**: Bill items, purchase items, credit note items, and debit note items store product details (name, part_number, hsn_code, uqc_code) as snapshots to preserve historical data even if product details change later.
- **Attachment Storage**: Purchase attachments store invoices, receipts, and other documents. Store file paths and MIME types for proper handling.
- **Credit Notes & Returns**: When creating credit notes (sales returns from customers), returned items are added back to stock_batches (quantity_remaining increased). The credit_note_batch_returns table tracks which batches received the returns, maintaining FIFO integrity.
- **Debit Notes & Returns**: When creating debit notes (purchase returns to vendors), returned items are removed from stock_batches (quantity_remaining decreased). The debit_note_batch_returns table tracks which batches lost inventory due to vendor returns.
