# Auto-Purchase Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic dummy purchase bill creation for insufficient stock during bill creation in the POS screen. When a bill is created with products that have insufficient stock, the system automatically creates purchase bills for the shortage amounts, allowing sales to proceed without manual intervention.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: If a bill required 4 units of a product but only 1 was available, the system would throw an error and block the bill creation.

**After**: The system automatically creates a dummy purchase for the 3-unit shortage, adds it to stock, and proceeds with bill creation seamlessly.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
1. **purchases table**:
   - Added `is_auto_purchase` (INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0): Flag to identify auto-generated purchases
   - Added `source_bill_id` (INTEGER, nullable): Links auto-purchase to the bill that triggered it

2. **vendors table**:
   - Added system vendor: `AUTO-STOCK-ADJUSTMENT` (id=7)
   - Used for all auto-generated purchases

### Code Changes

#### 1. purchase_repository.dart
**New Methods:**

```dart
// Generate auto-purchase number: AUTO-PUR-YYYYMMDD-XXX
Future<String> generateAutoPurchaseNumber(Transaction txn)

// Create auto-purchase within transaction
Future<int> createAutoPurchaseInTransaction(
  Transaction txn,
  int productId,
  String productName,
  String? partNumber,
  String? hsnCode,
  String? uqcCode,
  double costPrice,
  int quantity,
  int sourceBillId,
)
```

**Features:**
- Purchase number format: `AUTO-PUR-YYYYMMDD-XXX` (3-digit daily sequence)
- Sets `is_auto_purchase = 1` and `source_bill_id = <bill_id>`
- Creates purchase item with shortage quantity
- Creates stock batch with shortage quantity
- Uses bill item's cost price (not product's default)
- Tax amounts set to 0

#### 2. bill_repository.dart
**Modified Method:**

```dart
Future<int> createBill(Bill bill, List<BillItem> items)
```

**Changes:**
- Removed exception throwing for insufficient stock
- Added stock availability check for each item
- Calls `_createAutoPurchaseForShortage()` when stock is insufficient
- Creates auto-purchase **before** attempting bill item insertion

**New Helper Method:**

```dart
Future<void> _createAutoPurchaseForShortage(
  Transaction txn,
  int sourceBillId,
  int productId,
  String productName,
  String? partNumber,
  String? hsnCode,
  String? uqcCode,
  double costPrice,
  int shortage,
)
```

**Purpose:** Duplicates auto-purchase creation logic from PurchaseRepository to avoid circular dependency issues.

## Flow Diagram

```
User Creates Bill in POS
         ↓
For each product in cart:
         ↓
    Check available stock
         ↓
    Available < Required?
         ↓
        YES → Create auto-purchase for (Required - Available)
         │    - Purchase number: AUTO-PUR-20250114-001
         │    - Vendor: AUTO-STOCK-ADJUSTMENT (id=7)
         │    - Quantity: shortage amount
         │    - Cost: from bill item
         │    - Flags: is_auto_purchase=1, source_bill_id
         │    - Create stock batch with shortage quantity
         ↓
        NO → Continue
         ↓
Insert bill item
         ↓
Allocate stock from batches (FIFO)
         ↓
Bill created successfully
```

## Example Scenario

**Setup:**
- Product: "Engine Oil 5W-30"
- Available stock: 1 unit
- Bill requires: 4 units

**Process:**
1. User adds 4 units to cart
2. User clicks "Create Bill"
3. System detects shortage: 4 - 1 = 3 units
4. System creates auto-purchase:
   - Purchase number: `AUTO-PUR-20250114-001`
   - Vendor: `AUTO-STOCK-ADJUSTMENT`
   - Item: Engine Oil 5W-30, qty=3, cost=from bill item
   - Stock batch created with 3 units
5. System creates bill using all 4 units (1 old + 3 new)
6. Bill created successfully
7. User sees success message (unaware of auto-purchase)

## Verification

### Check Auto-Purchases Created
```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.purchase_number,
  p.source_bill_id,
  b.bill_number,
  p.total_amount,
  p.created_at
FROM purchases p
LEFT JOIN bills b ON p.source_bill_id = b.id
WHERE p.is_auto_purchase = 1
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Auto-Purchase Items
```sql
SELECT
  pi.product_name,
  pi.quantity,
  pi.cost_price,
  pi.total_amount,
  p.purchase_number
FROM purchase_items pi
INNER JOIN purchases p ON pi.purchase_id = p.id
WHERE p.is_auto_purchase = 1
ORDER BY pi.id DESC;
```

### Check Stock Batches
```sql
SELECT
  sb.batch_number,
  sb.product_id,
  sb.quantity_received,
  sb.quantity_remaining,
  sb.cost_price,
  p.purchase_number,
  p.is_auto_purchase
FROM stock_batches sb
LEFT JOIN purchase_items pi ON sb.purchase_item_id = pi.id
LEFT JOIN purchases p ON pi.purchase_id = p.id
WHERE p.is_auto_purchase = 1
ORDER BY sb.created_at DESC;
```

## Key Features

1. **Seamless User Experience**: User unaware of auto-purchase creation
2. **Transaction Safety**: All operations in single transaction (rollback on failure)
3. **FIFO Stock Allocation**: Uses oldest stock first, then newly created batches
4. **Audit Trail**: Auto-purchases linked to source bills via `source_bill_id`
5. **Sequential Numbering**: Daily sequence prevents conflicts
6. **Cost Price Tracking**: Uses bill item's cost price for accuracy
7. **Multiple Products**: Handles multiple products with different shortages in single bill

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Zero Stock**: Creates auto-purchase for full required quantity
2. **Partial Stock**: Creates auto-purchase for shortage only
3. **Multiple Products**: Creates separate auto-purchase for each shortage
4. **Same Day Multiple Bills**: Sequential numbering (001, 002, 003...)
5. **Concurrent Bills**: Transaction isolation prevents conflicts
6. **Large Quantities**: No limit on shortage amount

## Database Schema Reference

### purchases table (relevant columns)
```sql
id                      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
purchase_number         TEXT NOT NULL
vendor_id               INTEGER NOT NULL
subtotal                REAL NOT NULL
tax_amount              REAL NOT NULL
total_amount            REAL NOT NULL
is_auto_purchase        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0    -- NEW
source_bill_id          INTEGER                       -- NEW
created_at              TEXT NOT NULL
updated_at              TEXT NOT NULL
is_deleted              INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
```

### vendors table (system vendor)
```sql
id = 7
name = 'AUTO-STOCK-ADJUSTMENT'
legal_name = 'System Auto-Stock Adjustment'
gst_number = NULL
address = 'System Generated'
city = 'N/A'
state = 'N/A'
country = 'N/A'
pin_code = NULL
contact_person = 'System'
email = 'system@motobill.local'
mobile = NULL
phone = NULL
is_enabled = 1
is_deleted = 0
```

## Testing

See `AUTO_PURCHASE_TEST_SCENARIOS.md` for comprehensive test scenarios.

**Quick Test:**
1. Open POS screen
2. Select customer
3. Add product with low/zero stock (quantity > available)
4. Create bill
5. Verify bill created successfully
6. Query database to confirm auto-purchase created

**Manual Verification:**
```sql
-- Last auto-purchase created
SELECT * FROM purchases
WHERE is_auto_purchase = 1
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Its items
SELECT * FROM purchase_items
WHERE purchase_id = (SELECT id FROM purchases WHERE is_auto_purchase = 1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1);

-- Stock batch created
SELECT * FROM stock_batches
WHERE purchase_item_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM purchase_items
  WHERE purchase_id = (SELECT id FROM purchases WHERE is_auto_purchase = 1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1)
);
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No UI Notification**: User not informed about auto-purchase creation
2. **Cost Price Source**: Uses bill item's cost price (may differ from product's default)
3. **Zero Tax**: Auto-purchases have 0 tax amounts (can be enhanced)
4. **Hardcoded Vendor**: Requires vendor id=7 to exist
5. **No Toggle**: Feature always enabled (no on/off setting)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add notification when auto-purchase created
2. Add setting to enable/disable feature
3. Add UI indicator showing "Auto-stock added" badge
4. Add report for all auto-purchases
5. Add option to review/approve auto-purchases
6. Add threshold warnings (e.g., "Auto-adding 1000 units, confirm?")
7. Add tax calculation for auto-purchases
8. Allow custom vendor selection for auto-purchases
9. Add auto-purchase summary in bill print/PDF
